# ketchup republic introduction

Ketchup Republic is like a "Token Aroma" network in Physical Space, creating an incentive layer alongside the internet.


In this network, individuals can manage Token incentives in spaces ranging from 0.3 to 30 meters. Whether it's attracting fans, enticing customers to visit your shop, or renting out space.

There are two types of devices in Ketchup Republic. The first is K-NODE, a controllable node for distributing incentives. The second type utilizes existing BLE-supporting devices, Wild Node,which we also integrate into the network for broader incentive possibilities.

Unlike most projects, our K-NODEs are lightweight. They can even be set up using old phones, making them accessible and environmentally friendly.

Each K-NODE can also bind different numbers of NFTs, called K-Cards, to distinguish between business and incentive aspects. For example, in our Sample app, we've implemented an engaging card mining mechanism.

For promotion, we plan to showcase our product at the upcoming Token2049 conference, collaborating with projects to offer attendees a "participate & earn" experience.

Our team, with experience from Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, and others, chose Solana for its speed, low fees, programmability, and alignment with our IoT-focused philosophy.

This summarizes Ketchup Republic's core idea. We aim to provide a new Web3 advertising and incentive experience using Solana's advantages. Thank you!
